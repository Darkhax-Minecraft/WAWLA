# Frequently Asked Questions
**Does this mod work on servers?**    
Yes, this mod can be installed on both the client and server. While this mod is can be installed client side only, some features will require that the server have the mod installed as well. Keep in mind that if this mod is installed on the server, players will **not** be required to install to connect. 

**Could you add support for X mod or Y feature?**    
I would love to add support for as many features as possible, however I am not very familiar with other mods. If you have a suggestion please create a new GitHub issue with general info about how it works. 

**Can I use this mod in my mod pack?**    
Yes, just remember to give credit and link back to the [official download page](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/wawla-what-are-we-looking-at).

**What relation does this mod have with Waila?**    
Wawla started off as an add-on for WAILA. While Wawla is primarily a Waila add-on, it now revolves around the info engine system. This system allows Wawla to run without Waila installed, and will also allow Wawla to work with other Waila alternatives. 

**How does the info engine work?**    
The info engine system puts a layer between the features in Wawla, and the mod which displays the information to the player, which I refer to as an info engine. This provides independence from WAILA and allows the mod to run without it. For example, Wawla is now includes a small mini-mod called ICSE (I can see everything) which is used as a fallback engine. In the future I plan to add support for other mods like The One Probe.
